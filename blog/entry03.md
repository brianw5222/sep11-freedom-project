Freedom project is a project where we use some code to make some website and this year we are using javascript. This year I am using kaboom.js and I am making a RPG game.

I learn about the fundemental movements and dialogue in a rpg game. To make a [player](https://kaboomjs.com/#add.com) or any [character](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/kaboom-js/#Load-your-Sprites-and-Create-a-Player), you need to make their body. A body may consist of the following:

     sprite("bob"), name
     pos(x,y), position
     area(), shows that the object is solid and can collide
     body(), same thing as area(), except it shows it have gravity
     health(), sets hp so if there is anything that does damage to the player, they lose it.

I am planning to make some interactive objects next like a key and a door to open. I might get a timer to see if anyone can speedrun it.

In SEP, there is a thing called EDP, where it talks about our process. I am currently on Create a prototype. A skill I learned is Attention to detail because each line of code must be correct and the spelling too. One example is the in the link, I put the name "elefant" instead "elephant", so the terminal said that it couldn't find it. Another example is the parentheses and semicolons. If you miss one, it will stop the code from running past that, causing glitches.
