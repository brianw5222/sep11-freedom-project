The freedom project is a year-long project where one need to make a project with a tool you use this year. In this year, I used kaboom.js.

A takeaway from the Expo elevator pitch is to talk in a slower pace. When I talk, I just keep talking and just think about finishing the pitch and not think if they can understand. This cause the judge to ask me a question that I already said in my pitch. Anothing takeaway is to make it simple. Since the judge are not the one making the project and learning the tools, they might not understand the code. This is the [Link to the Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15uKSRGUXYdZx9ChM98sp-IbdI7qqk4wSY7KoxyFwsjg/edit).


A takeaway for the Freedom Project slides is to do more of the slides, I did mines in like 5 minutes, but I don't have all the content covered. One of the feedback I got is:

`It would have been nice to see more of both product and process.`

Another takeaway is to be more specific. When I present, I try to keep it as simple as possible but didn't explain it and the feedback I got was:

`And takeaways were lacking because you said to ask for help but that you didn't.`

I am on the `Communicate the results` step in the EDP. I show the judge the project already and got grades for it. Don't really know what to do now.

Some skills that I learn is `communication` and `How to read`. I feel that I have strengthened communication, because I have to read the slides to my classmates and to the judges. I also feel I have gotten better at How to read, because I had to do a lot of research to understand much of what there is to understand how to explain all the documentations of my code.
